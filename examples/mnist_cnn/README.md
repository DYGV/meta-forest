# Forest Example Project - Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Digit Recognition

This example project consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) running on the FPGA being applied to the MNIST digit recognition task.

## Introduction and Design Files

The ROS2-FPGA node generated by Forest in this example is used in the inference task of MNIST digit recognition. The neural network is first trained
in a CPU by using TensorFlow Keras, and the weights and biases are saved in a file and stored in the FPGA using read-only memories (ROMs).

The neural network architecture used in this example is shown in the image below:
