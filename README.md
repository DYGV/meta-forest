# meta-FOrEST
meta-FOrEST is an automatic generation tool for multiple ROS2-FPGA nodes.

## Installation

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install git+https://github.com/DYGV/meta-forest
```

## Usage
**See the [FFT example](./examples/FFT) for usage.** More explanations and examples will be added in the future.  
Caution: The types available for meta-FOrEST are the same as for [FOrEST's type support](https://github.com/ros2-forest/forest/tree/master/docs/tutorials#type-support).
